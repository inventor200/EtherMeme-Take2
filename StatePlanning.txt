Idle: Sacrifice nothing, but will add trace
Bury: Sacrifice movement and sight for protection and invisibility; minimal trace as hint
Ascend: Sacrifice interaction for intel
Stealth: Sacrifice navigation and pings for invisibility and near-zero trace

   * Will be held in place, but cannot move on will.
  ** Needs to be in close proximity on upper layer; is not visible to hostile tides.
 *** Will show up on map, but will blend in perfectly with tides.
     Will only be revealed in hostile or manic tides.
     Will not be hidden from predators.
**** "Asked-Predator" will flash when recalling ask-trace from anyone going ahead-full.

[1] Cannot stay buried forever; eventually will risk ship after time expires.
    Probes can stay buried forever, though, and will leave no trace.

[2] Nothing can remain ascended for very long. Predators will pull prey up to
    "drown" them via ascension. Movement when ascended is 10x faster.
    Bring ascended recalibrates your expected position.

[3] Ships listening for a target will get immediate results if the target is also
    ascended, and the trace will vanish instantly when the target descends.
    Trace also provides zero direction component when ascended; results are all-
    encompassing.

[4] The "Excite" action does a few things by making manic tides:
    1. Takes 30 sec to complete.
    2. Wards away predators (when complete).
    3. Makes you VERY visible.
    4. Creates a zone where stealth fails (when complete).
    5. Dumps a lot of your trace into the area, creating a strong, all-surrounding response if pinged.
    6. Makes trace last a LOT longer.

[5] The "Seizure" ping action can only be performed 3 times, and does a few things:
    1. Anyone caught at the scene of a seizures gets 1 of 2 strikes.
    2. At 2 strikes, they are forcefully ejected, and their destination is dictated by who controls the tether.
    3. The region becomes instantly and PERMANENTLY hostile (ships cannot remain there for long, and buried ships have VERY little time to stay buried).
    4. Two new predators are born.
    5. A ship can launch their single decoy and enter stealth, in order to evade the predator if it's their first strike.
    6. At the second strike, decoys will not work.
       Because of this, if the player used a seizure ping, and the target was not there, the decoy can be used to bail.
       However, if the target WAS there, then a second can be used to cancel out the target's decoy.

PROBE TYPES:
    Decoy (equipped: 1 | Non-recoverable)
        When deployed, the ship is automatically put into stealth, and will be completely hidden from predators and all tides
        until they next leave stealth mode.
    Hacker (equipped: 3 | Recoverable* | Sinks after use)
        Ascends, and then buries itself, carrying with it calibrated coordinates, and tether ownership status.
        When deployed in attack mode, it will retake the tether after 10 seconds, and not return.
    Spy (equipped: 2 | Recoverable | Rendezvous after use)
        Will wander in a set search pattern, ping, and record all traces found.
        This probe does not leave a trace.
        The enemy can see this probe ping, but the probe itself will not show up.
        Predators can sometimes attack probes.
        When it reaches its final instruction, it will oscillate between being buried and ascending, in order to hold position and transmit updates
        to its owner when the owner is ascended at the same time. The owner will have a timer that goes off when the probe should have finished its
        mission, so the player knows when to ascend to listen for a message.
        If two spy probes are active, they will try to stay outside of some distance from each other, to maximize the search area.
