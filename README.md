# EtherMeme
## A surreal stealth hunting game
### Premise

One day, the strange, amorphous Ether appeared in orbit of Earth.
It seemed to be a colony of hyper-dimensional neurons.
Curious (and legion), the colony has reached across many other worlds
of scientific interest, in order to observe and ponder the inhabitants
found there. Through higher dimensions, the neurons weave through
unseen space, keeping their vast colony-mind intact.

It wasn't long before freight companies took advantage of this
incredible opportunity. By covering the surfaces of a ship in neuro-tide
interfaces, the ship is able to conversate its way through the colony,
transiting from point A to point B.

Even less time passed before pirates sprang into action, disrupting
regions of neuro-tides in the colony to force freighters to be
discharged into normal space, at which point they were taken hostage.

Your job is simple: Enter the Ether, gain intel from the local tides
of the colony, locate the pirates, and forcefully expel them to a
pre-determined point in normal space for arrest.

Make sure you don't fall into any of their traps, though!

And be even more careful of the predatory tides that lurk deep within
the Ether!

### Status

This game is currently a work in progress, and is still in the early
alpha stages of development.

### Credit

Special thanks to @Oxeren for their [Distance Shader](https://github.com/Oxeren/Blur-Distance-Blur-for-Unity-Postprocessing-Stack-v2)
for Unity3D; the old blur shader was removed from Postprocessing when the
tech graduated to the V2 stack, and all the alternatives are for the
universal pipeline.

Without Oxeren's repo, I would have lost a lot of time trying to write a
renderer for the boid-based neurotides.
